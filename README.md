ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning)

1. Built and evaluated multiple ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict customer churn with an accuracy of ~78%.

2. Preprocessed raw data through feature engineering, encoding, and scaling, improving model performance and interpretability.

3. Analyzed results using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score, ensuring balanced precision and recall.

4. Optimized model through hyperparameter tuning and developed a deployable workflow for real-world business applications.
