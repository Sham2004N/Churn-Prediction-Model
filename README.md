# Churn-Prediction-Model

ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction Model
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical customer data.

ðŸš€ Project Highlights:
Cleaned and preprocessed raw customer data
Handled class imbalance using SMOTE
Performed feature encoding and scaling
Trained multiple models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost
Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Saved the best model using pickle for future use

ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries:
Python
pandas, NumPy
scikit-learn
XGBoost
imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
seaborn, matplotlib

âœ… Outcome:
The final XGBoost model achieved high accuracy and is capable of predicting whether a customer is likely to churn, helping businesses take proactive action.
